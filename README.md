# this is a work in progress not reqsy for production.


this library is heavily inspired in nativewind transforming css to js, but without the use of babel or tailwind cli, instead this lib uses talwind itself and postcss in the runtime. 

postcss runs only on react-native talwind is bundled into the core package (this idea was readapted from tw-to-css lib), for web we uses tailwind and postcss jusk like any react peoject, but you need to use our styled componends or create your ouwn styled components using the styled lib.

this library has being tested using react 18 and expo 48.

# Universal React Native + Web + Tailwindcss
